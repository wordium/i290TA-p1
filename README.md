Live URL of where it's hosted:

Browser:
 - Chrome 21.0
 - Firefox 15.0 (but it looks a little ugly)

Bugs/Quirks
 - Trails cannot be made or edited until the user chooses a radio button (none by default, so the target is not droppable).
 - Vague Delicious tags will return spam
 - Bookmark search can sometimes be slow
